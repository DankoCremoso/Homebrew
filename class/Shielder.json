Even when they ultimately fail, Pugilists go down swinging.",

This is not an esoteric or mystical energy that flows through the multiverse, but the result of self-confidence and determination forged over a lifetime of hardship with a never-say-die attitude. Anyone can be taught how to fist fight but accessing the strength and resilience of the Pugilist can't. The secret of mastering moxie doesn't come from disciplined study or rigorous training, it comes from years of wanting and needing.",
						"In back alleys, underground fight clubs, and poorer quarters, Pugilists don't have time to consider the lofty ideals of philosophy or ponder the mysteries of the universe. They spend their days chasing down their next meal or, if they're fortunate enough to have that, their next drink, bedfellow, or flophouse. For Pugilists, becoming an adventurer might be the only way out of whatever miserable situation they've been stuck in since infancy. For others, getting lost out in the world is an escape from the tangled web of debt or enemies they've piled up. But some Pugilists are happy just with the promise of ample opportunities to bloody their knuckles."
